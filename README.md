## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for training)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster training)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tomato-leaf-disease-detection.git
   cd tomato-leaf-disease-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv tomato_env
   source tomato_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: tomato_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the trained model:**
   - Ensure `tomato_leaf_final_model.h5` is in the project root directory
   - If not available, train the model using `enhanced_4conv_model_with_save.py`

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Running the GUI Application

1. **Navigate to the app directory:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. **Launch the application:**
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

3. **Using the Application:**
   - Click "Upload Image" to select a tomato leaf image
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIF, TIFF
   - View the prediction result below the image
   - Use "Reset" to clear the current image and result
   - Click "About" for project information

### Training a New Model

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Organize images in `data/train/` and `data/val/` folders
   - Create subfolders for each disease class
   - Ensure balanced dataset with sufficient images per class

2. **Run the training script:**
   ```bash
   python enhanced_4conv_model_with_save.py
   ```

3. **Monitor training:**
   - Training runs for 20 epochs with automatic learning rate reduction
   - View accuracy and loss plots during training
   - Model automatically saves as `tomato_leaf_final_model.h5`
